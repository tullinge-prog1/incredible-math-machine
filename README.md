# Incredible Math Machine - Find the errors!

## Start here
Hello there comrade! Our **Incredible math machine** is not working at all! The lousy programmer who coded it is now gone, probably hiding in shame. Can you help us out and solve it before the big launch tomorrow?

1. Fix the code so that it asks the user for two numbers and then displays the answer correctly
   
2. Also, log the input numbers and the results to the console

3. Do a `git add .` and `git commit -m "Mission complete"`

## When you are done
I'd like you to push these changes to a repository of your own, just in case. Therefore, do the following:

1. Create an empty repository named `incredible-math-machine` on your Github account

2. Remove the existing remote `origin` which points to `https://github.com/tullinge-prog1/incredible-math-machine.git`. Do this by writing `git remote remove origin`

3. Add the correct remote for your new repository. Let's still call it `origin`. Do this by using `git remote add origin https://________________.git` (but with your new remote URL of course)

4. Push the changes to your new remote by writing `git push`
