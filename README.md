# Find the error

## Start here
Hello there comrade! Our **Incredible math machine** is not working properly. The lousy programmer who coded it is now gone. Can you solve it for us?

1. Fix the code so that it asks the user for two numbers and then displays the answer correctly
   
2. Also, log the input numbers and the results to the console

3. Do a `git add .` and `git commit -m "Mission complete"`

## When you are done
I'd like you to push these changes to a repository of your own, just in case. Therefore, do the following:

1. Create an empty repository named `find-the-error` on your Github account

2. Remove the existing remote `origin` which points to `https://github.com/tullinge-prog1/find-the-error.git`. Do this by writing `git remote remove origin`

3. Add the correct remote for your new repository. Let's still call it `origin`. Do this by writing `git remote add origin https://.THE NEW URL .git`

4. Push the changes by writing `git push`
